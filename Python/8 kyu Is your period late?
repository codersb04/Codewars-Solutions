Question:
In this kata, we will make a function to test whether a period is late.

Our function will take three parameters:

last - The Date object with the date of the last period

today - The Date object with the date of the check

cycleLength - Integer representing the length of the cycle in days

Return true if the number of days passed from last to today is greater than cycleLength. Otherwise, return false.
"""

Solution:

def period_is_late(last,today,cycle_length):
    return (today-last).days > cycle_length 

Explanation: last and today both are already in date format, just taking the difference will give the result. The result would be in timedelta format(That date together with time), to extract the days we just use the 'days' function.
